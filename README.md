# PYMAS 🐍🎄

_A set of fun Python holiday projects for beginners_

## What is PYMAS?
PYMAS is a collection of 5 Python project ideas created to help brand new coders or beginner coders explore and practice in a relaxed, playful, and holiday-themed way.

In this repository you will find 5 folders number 1 to 5. For example, you can do a project on the weekend for each week of december. Or do them all on 5 free days. And you can do them with kids, in the classroom or at home!

Inside each folder you will find a simple guide, clearly explaining the steps and giving ideas for further exploration and self-contained Python scripts. Non of the codes require any installed requirements besides the Python language (commonly pre-installed in modern computers).

I wish you merry Python Christmas, (ehem pymas).

## What's inside?
Here are some of the included projects:
* `1_christmas_greeting_generator/` — a simple script to generate greeting messages.
* `2_ascii_christmas_tree/` — ASCII art representation of a Christmas tree.
* `3_hot_chocolate_recipe/` — a “recipe” program that tells the ingredients you need.
* `4_new_year_countdown/` — countdown to New Year type of script.
* `5_snowball_gift/` — a fun little program feature some basic geometry.

As previously mentioned, each folder is a self-contained project: open it, explore the .py file(s), run them, modify them.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python installed. If not you can download it at [python.org](https://python.org).
2. Clone this repository: open the terminal, copy-paste the next commands and press enter to run them
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joanalnu/pymas.git
cd pymas
```
3. Pick a project folder and enter them running `cd <name of the project folder>` in the terminal.
4. Run `open GUIDE.md` to open the guide or `open example_<project name>.py` for the script. You can run the example script (which is exactly the same as in the guide's code boxes) by running `python example_<project name>.py` in the terminal.
5. Create you our script, tweak it, change it, and have fun!
