# PYMAS 🐍🎄

_A set of fun Python holiday projects for absolute beginners_

## What is PYMAS?

PYMAS is a collection of 5 Python project ideas created to help brand new coders or beginner coders explore and practice in a relaxed, playful, and holiday-themed way.

In this repository you will find 5 folders numbered 1 to 5. For example, you can do one project on the weekend for each week of December. Or do them all on 5 free days. And you can do them with kids, in the classroom, or at home!

Inside each folder you will find:
- **A simple, detailed guide** - Clearly explaining each step with beginner-friendly explanations of Python concepts like variables, data types, lists, loops, and more
- **Commented example scripts** - Self-contained Python scripts with line-by-line comments explaining what's happening
- **Challenge ideas** - Fun ways to extend and modify your code

**No installation required!** All projects use only Python's built-in features (no external packages needed—Python comes pre-installed on most computers).

If you aren't used to git/GitHub, you can see the identical instructions and guides on this website: [PYMAS website](https://joanalnu.github.io/pymas).

_I wish you a merry Python Christmas! (ehem, pymas)_

## What's Inside?

Here are the 5 included projects:

1. **`1_christmas_greeting_generator/`** — Learn about **lists** and **randomness**. Create a script that picks a random holiday greeting each time you run it.
   - _Concepts: Lists, imports, random selection_

2. **`2_ascii_christmas_tree/`** — Learn about **loops** and **string repetition**. Build ASCII art of a Christmas tree by repeating characters.
   - _Concepts: Loops, string multiplication, variables_

3. **`3_hot_chocolate_recipe/`** — Learn about **dictionaries**. Calculate ingredient amounts for hot chocolate based on how many people you're serving.
   - _Concepts: Dictionaries, key-value pairs, loops, user input_

4. **`4_new_year_countdown/`** — Learn about **dates and time** using Python's datetime module. Calculate exactly how long until New Year!
   - _Concepts: Modules, date arithmetic, division operators, f-strings_

5. **`5_snowball_gift/`** — Learn about **math formulas and exponents**. Calculate the volume of a snowball and how much paper you need to wrap it.
   - _Concepts: Mathematical operators, exponents, the math module, f-strings_

Each folder is self-contained: open it, read the guide, explore the example script, run it, and modify it to make it your own!

## Learning Path

The projects are designed to progressively teach fundamental Python concepts:

- **Project 1**: Variables and lists
- **Project 2**: Loops and strings
- **Project 3**: Dictionaries and data structures
- **Project 4**: Modules and working with dates
- **Project 5**: Mathematical operations and formulas

## What You'll Learn

By working through these projects, you'll understand:
- **Data Types**: Strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries
- **Variables**: How to store and use information
- **Control Flow**: Loops and how to repeat code
- **Functions**: Built-in functions like `input()`, `print()`, `range()`
- **Modules**: How to import and use Python's tools like `random`, `datetime`, and `math`
- **f-strings**: How to format and display information
- **User Input**: How to ask the user for information and use it in your code
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down problems and building solutions step by step

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download it at [python.org](https://python.org).

### 2. Get the Code
Clone this repository by opening the terminal and running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joanalnu/pymas.git
cd pymas
```

### 3. Pick a Project
Navigate to a project folder:
```bash
cd 1_christmas_greeting_generator
```

### 4. Read the Guide
Open the guide to understand the concepts:
```bash
open GUIDE.md
```

### 5. Explore the Example
Look at the example script with detailed comments:
```bash
open example_greeting_generator.py
```

Or view it in your code editor.

### 6. Run the Script
Execute the example to see it in action:
```bash
python example_greeting_generator.py
```

### 7. Create Your Own
Now create your own script! Modify the example, add new features, and experiment. This is where the real learning happens!

### 8. Try the Challenges
Each guide includes challenge ideas to push yourself further. Have fun with them!

## Tips for Beginners

- **Read the comments!** Every example script has detailed comments explaining what each line does.
- **Experiment** - Change the code and see what happens. Breaking things is how you learn!
- **Use the guides** - Each GUIDE.md explains concepts before showing code.
- **Run frequently** - After each small change, run your script to see the results.
- **Take notes** - Write down new concepts you learn.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know Python already?**
A: No! These projects are designed for absolute beginners. We explain everything step by step.

**Q: What if I get an error?**
A: Read the error message carefully—it usually tells you what went wrong! Check:
- Spelling and capitalization
- Missing colons (`:`) at the end of lines with `for` or `if`
- Matching parentheses and quotes

**Q: Can I use these in a classroom?**
A: Absolutely! These projects work great for teaching groups. Adjust the pace to your needs.

**Q: Can I modify these projects?**
A: Yes! The code is open source (MIT license). Remix them, extend them, make them your own!

## Contribution

I'd love to hear from you! How did you use PYMAS? Do you have suggestions or questions?

Together we can enhance this project. Maybe even a summer school edition or a compact spring break series...
